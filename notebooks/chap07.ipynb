    "## Introduction\n",
    "Cellular automata have applications in various areas, including physics, biology, and many others. Here are some examples that could be described as a cellular automaton, traffic flows, forest fires, running water, liquid dissolving, and air patterns. People have been wondering whether the universe is a cellular automaton or not. If it is, then we will be able to gain new information and have a further understanding of it. Then, one might wonder if our world, which is currently well described, at our current level of understanding, by physics with particle-like objects, could be a CA at its most fundamental level. Many scholars have tried to develop theories in order to understand our world based on cellular automata. Edward Fredkin exposed what he terms the \"finite nature hypothesis,\" which is the idea that \"ultimately every quantity of physics, including space and time, will turn out to be discrete and finite.\" CA methods allow the simulation of a wide range of real-world effects and situations so far.

    "Diffusion is the movement of a substance from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration.\n",

    "Before we get to a Reaction-Diffusion model, we'll start with simple diffusion. The kernel computes the difference between each cell and the sum of its neighbors. At each time step, we compute this difference, multiply by a constant, and add it back in to the array."

    "\n",
    "In the percolation model, each cell is porous with probability `p` or non-porous with the probability `1-p`.  We start with a row of wet cells at the time.  During each time step, a cell becomes wet if it is porous and at least one neighbor is wet (using a 4-cell neighborhood).  For each value of `p` we compute the probability that water reaches the bottom row.\n",

We start with a row of wet cells at the top follow by a random array of porus and non-porus cells based on the probablity `q`. We will iterate through to cells and if the cells have any wet neighbor, the cell itself will become a wet cell. This will continue until we reach the bottom row or if there is no longer any changes.\n",

    "### Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Eleni L.** -  I engaged with physical modeling, cellular automata and analyzed the complexity of the functions on those sections. I became more knowledgeable about the topics of Diffusion and Reaction, and how the change in the concentration is calculated while reaction and diffusion is happening. I found the applications extremely interesting, as it is important in both the molecular, cellular, and daily life. Last but not least, I got used to GitHub and how to work on GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Imma** - I got to learn about fractals and the different patterns in nature that are formed by the use of fractals. I also learned more about how to avoid merge conflicts in Jupiter notebooks by working on the same document since different images were rendered when each of us ran the notebooks and that caused some errors. Additionally, I spent quite some time thinking about complexity with my team, I would say that this assignment allowed me to broaden my understanding of complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**May** - I learned about complexity and what physical modeling is. I also learned about the diffusion models but since I focused mostly on the percolation section, I have a very deep understanding of the purpose of the model and how it works. We can use percolation models outside of just liquid as they can be used to also study epidemics and network electron resistors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Cellular automata have been an important topic for complexity analysis. While it has multiple applications in various areas, some of them include diffusion, reaction, and fractal patterns that appear in nature. Many times people have described natural phenomena on the cellular level, but people have been wondering whether the universe can be described as a cellular automaton or not. In our project: \n",
    "1. We understood more about how some physical modelings work\n",
    "2. We can represent real-life applications with the use of cellular automata\n",
    "3. We analyzed the function provided and examined the complexity\n",
    "4. We got more insight into how simple patterns can make up complex Level 4 models through recursive division such as in fractals.\n",
